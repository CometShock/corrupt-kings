A SkyStrife World Extension to permissionlessly collude with other players to defeat a common enemy.

Uses MUD v2 World Extensions

## Problem

While playing SkyStrife, several difficult tactical situations emerge that often have extreme cascading effects.

### Stalemates
For example, there may be 3 players remaining of roughly equal strength. It is in each players' best interest to be non-combative as much as possible to minimize their resources and units expended. Thus, a stalemate with no conclusion extends the game time significantly as players posture strength and hope that the other two players elect to battle.

### Overly Dominant Leaders
A highly skilled player may be in a much higher position to win than the remaining players and establish dominance. The remaining players sometimes are fearful enough of the dominant player and only attack each other, further weakening their position and solidifying that the highest they can score in the game is 2nd place.

## Solution

Enable players to create tokens that represent their future match $ORB ERC-20 winnings and swap them with other players in the same match. This creates soft incentives for players to coordinate with each other to defeat a common enemy before defeating each other.
